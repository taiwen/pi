Pi Engine
=================

Pi Engine is a role oriented application development engine for web and mobile, designed as the next generation and a successor to Xoops.
Pi is developed upon PHP and MySQL with selected third-party frameworks including but not limited to [Zend Framework library](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) and [Backbone](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone).

Pi Project follows the philosophy of open standard, open design, open development and open structure. Pi is born as a complete open source project and intended to build a sustainable ecosystem that benefits all contributors and users. 

[Pi Team](https://github.com/pi-engine/pi/wiki/Pi-Team) is highly inspired by the Xoops  led by onokazu (Ono Kazumi), skalpa and phppp (Taiwen Jiang, or D.J.) since 2001 and will continue to support and promote Xoops.
